🕵️‍♂️ Autonomous Market Intelligence Squad

Live Demo: https://enterprise-agent-squad.streamlit.app/

📌 Project Description

The Autonomous Market Intelligence Squad is an industry-level Multi-Agent AI orchestration system designed to automate research, strategic analysis, and executive reporting. Instead of relying on a single LLM prompt, this system coordinates multiple specialized AI agents that collaborate to complete complex research workflows autonomously.

Built using CrewAI and powered by Llama-3.3-70B via Groq, the system performs factual retrieval, strategic evaluation, and professional report generation in under 60 seconds.

This project demonstrates the real-world power of Agentic AI in eliminating manual data gathering and transforming raw information into structured, decision-ready insights.

🚀 Key Highlights

Multi-Agent Architecture – Three specialized agents: Researcher, Analyst, and Editor

Autonomous Tool Usage – Wikipedia API integration for real-time knowledge retrieval

High-Speed Inference – Groq-powered Llama-3.3-70B for fast reasoning

Interactive Web App – Built using Streamlit

Downloadable Reports – Generates professional Markdown reports
